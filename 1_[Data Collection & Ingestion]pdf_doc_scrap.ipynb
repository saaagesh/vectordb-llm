It supports labeling for image, video, text, and audio as well as centralized management of labeled data.  AI Platform Neural Architecture Search (NAS)  NAS is a managed service leveraging Google's neural architecture search technology to generate, evaluate, and train numerous model architectures for a customer's application. NAS training services facilitate management of large -scale experiments.  AI Platform Training and Prediction  AI Platform Training and Prediction is a managed service that enables users to easily build machine learning models with popular frameworks like TensorFlow, XGBoost and Scikit Learn. It provides scalable training and prediction services that work on large datasets.  Anti Money Laun dering (AML) AI  AML AI is a machine learning engine which takes customer data and training labels to create a tailored model covering an extensible typology of risks for AML along with governance documentation to ease adoption in this highly regulated envi ronment.  AutoML Natural Language  AutoML Natural Language enables customers to categorize input text into their own custom defined labels (supervised classification). Users can customize models to their own domain or use case.  AutoML Tables  AutoML Tables en ables data scientists, analysts, and developers to automatically build and deploy machine learning models on structured data at increased speed and scale.  AutoML Translation  AutoML Translation is a simple and scalable translation solution that allows busin esses and developers with limited machine learning expertise to customize the Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) model for their own domain or use -case.  AutoML Video  AutoML Video delivers a simple and flexible machine learning service that lets busin esses and customer developers train custom and scalable video models for specific domains or use cases.  AutoML Vision  AutoML Vision is a simple and flexible machine learning service that lets businesses and developers with limited machine learning expertis e train custom and scalable vision models for their own use cases.  ryanrichard@google.comGoogle Confidental Information\", metadata={'source': '../sources/GCP-[Winter-2023] GCP SOC 2..pdf', 'score': 0.7921857237815857}),\n",

Speech -to-Text Speech -to-Text allows developers to convert audio to text by a pplying powerful neural network models in an easy to use API.  Talent Solution  Talent Solution offers access to Google's machine learning, enabling company career sites, job boards, ATS, staffing agencies, and other recruitment technology platforms to impro ve the talent acquisition experience.  Text-to-Speech  Text-to-Speech synthesizes human -like speech based on input text in a variety of voices and languages.  Vertex AI  Vertex AI is a service for managing the entire lifecycle of AI and machine learning develo pment. With Vertex AI, one can (i) manage image, video, text, and tabular datasets and associated labels, (ii) build machine learning pipelines to train and evaluate models using Google Cloud algorithms or custom training code, and (iii) deploy models for online or batch use cases all on scalable managed infrastructure (including additional discovery points and API endpoints for functionality replacing the legacy services of AI Platform Data Labeling, AI Platform Training and Prediction, AutoML Natural Lang uage, AutoML Video, AutoML Vision, and AutoML Tables).  Video Intelligence API  Video Intelligence API makes videos searchable, and discoverable, by extracting metadata through a REST API. It annotates videos stored in Google Cloud Storage and helps identify  key noun entities in a video and when they occur within the video.  API Management  Apigee  Apigee is a full -lifecycle API management platform that lets customers design, secure, analyze, and scale APIs, giving them visibility and control. Apigee is availabl e as Apigee, a fully -managed service, Apigee hybrid, a hybrid model that's partially hosted and managed by the customer, or Apigee Private Cloud, an entirely customer hosted Premium Software solution.
